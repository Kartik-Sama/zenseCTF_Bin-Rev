## Notes
* Understanding each function is key.
* Rand.seed(n) is a controlled way of generating random numbers. Given a seed same set of random numbers (no more random lol) are generated.
* For an odd length string when broken into half length/2 character occurs in second half thus while reversing this function it was to be made sure length/2 + 1 is swapped with the later half while reversing.
